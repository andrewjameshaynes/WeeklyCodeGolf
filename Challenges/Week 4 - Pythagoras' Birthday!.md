# Challenge #4 - Happy Birthday Pythagoras!:

If he were alive today, today would be Pythagoras’ 2657th Birthday - and as he was a big fan of triangles, I thought we could celebrate with a suitable challenge. We are going to make a triangle checker.

### Your Task:
Given the cartesian points for a triangle, I want you to tell me what type of triangle that makes (Equilateral, Isosceles, Scalene, Right-angled).

The input is your choice of two vectors, x and y, that contain 3 points each or it can be a dataset with 2 columns (x and y) with 3 rows.
The output should be a print to console or log specifying it’s type (correctly spelled).

### Example:
x=(1,1.5,1.5), y=(2,2,3) -> Right-angled

Remember this is *code golf*! so the shortest answer wins.

###### T&C’s apply. May not actually be Pythagoras’ birthday.
