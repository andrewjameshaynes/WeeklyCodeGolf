# Challenge #9 - Double Trouble

As it could be a busy day today, Iâ€™m offering up two smaller challenges - one XMASSY :gift: and one hopefully quick solution. Have a go at one, or both!

## First Challenge - Output me a Xmas Tree

Output a Christmas tree :christmas_tree: of any form, any style you like, in as few bytes as possible. There are some rules:

- Your Xmas tree should be triangular in shape, small at the top, bigger at the bottom
- It must be at least 10 tiers high
- It must have a base/pot below, even if it is just a single character

Shortest code wins, and best tree will also win!

## Second Challenge - Create a program that doubles in size :arrow_double_down:

You need to write a program that when you run it once, outputs a whole number > 1.

The **same source code** when repeated twice should return that number doubled, and then when you double the code again should double the number again.. and so on.

Good luck and shortest code wins!
