# Challenge #21 - Hush Hush :pig:

Everything is a little secretive this week, so I’ve decided it’s probably best if we talk in coded messages! And because we’re programmers we can create programs that do that for us.

This given argot we’re gonna use is Pyg Latin - this is where you remove the first letter of the first word and create a second word with it after by appending “ay” to it.

### Task:

Create at least one function, data step, macro or program that when given a string in english outputs the pyg latin equivalent, and when given a pyg latin string will return the english.
(You may use two functions for this)

### Example:

- andrew -> ndrew aay
- naomi -> aomi nay
- hello world -> ello hay orld way

Remember, this is code golf - so shortest code wins!
