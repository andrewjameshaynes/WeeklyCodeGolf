# Challenge #7 - Multiverse Mayhem!

Sorry I’m late today guys, but I had to do some investigating, and as I feared, **we’re trapped in a parallel universe!** :scream: :alien:

Luckily on my way in, I discovered a device that will transport us back as long as we supply the year we want to return to. Unfortunately in this universe keyboards don’t have numbers on them! :scream:

Even worse, the console has an (unknown) limited input, so we’ll have to create the shortest program we can to get us home before the gateway shuts at 4:30pm! :clock430:

### Task:
Armed with your favourite programming language, create a program that will output the number 2017 without using any numbers in your source code.

### Rules
- No numbers in source code
- No built in (or imported) date functions to get todays date
