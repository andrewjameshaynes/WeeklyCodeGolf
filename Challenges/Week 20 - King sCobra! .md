# Challenge #20 - King sCobra :wave:

In celebration of Scott leaving for 8 months, we’re going to make him a program that outputs a data snake! :snake:

We are going to make our snakes by creating a spiral with words in your favourite programming language.

### Task:
Create a function, data step, macro or program that when run outputs a spiral with the string “Snake” on repeat.

The spiral function is irrelevant (so get mathematically creative) but the spiral will have to be judged adequate by everyone involved.

### Rules:

- The Spiral must start with “Snake” not “nake” or “ke” etc, and must go on continuously.

Remember, this is code golf - so shortest code wins!
