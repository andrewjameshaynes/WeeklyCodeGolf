# Challenge #5 - Unluckiest Man Alive

As some of you may know, I don’t often gamble - because I never, ever win. This isn’t me putting myself down, I am just incapable of winning any bets in a year that contains a Friday 13th :scream:

### Your Task:

Given a year as either an integer or a string, I wan’t you to create me a program, function, macro, data step or query that outputs me the number of Friday 13th’s in that year. :crystal_ball:

### Example:
2017 - Had 2 Friday 13th’s! One in January, and one in October.

### Extension:

For those of you who want more, the unluckiest year is a year that has THREE Friday 13th’s! Also known as a _Triskadekatriannos*_.

To combat these unlucky spirits, I want you to do as above, but when a year is a Triskadekatriannos, I want you to output me a four-leaf clover :four_leaf_clover:
(Hint: There is a unicode for this)
