# Challenge #16 - Analytics Click-and-Run 2018!! :video_game:

Good Morning Everyone!

Today is the unveiling of our new Analytics Video Game about automating standard reporting - Click-and-Run!

The base element of the game is that you run a standard legacy report in real time, then go back in time and create an automated, updated version to see if you can improve on the run time! :heart_eyes:

I've coded the entire game except for one tiny detail which is bamboozling me - I need to get the end of month dates programmatically and just can't work it out :confused:

### Task:

Given a string of the form "dd-mm-yyyy", I want you to write me a program, function datastep or macro that outputs the last day of the last month *as a date object*. Output format is up to you as long as it's sensible.

Examples (all are acceptable):

1) "31-12-2017" -> 30-11-2017 
2) "17-02-2018" -> 31-Jan-2018
3) "01-01-1457" -> 31DEC1456
