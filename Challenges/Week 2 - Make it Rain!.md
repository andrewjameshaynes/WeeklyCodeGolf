**Challenge #2 - MAKE IT RAIN** (with letters):

I thought it was gonna rain today, which is a shame cause I like to go running in the rain. But we’re clever people, how about we make our own rain?

**Your Task**:

Given a character string as input, you need to output me to the console some alphabet rain. Alphabet rain consists of repeating the inputted string vertically, where each character is repeated as many times as its index in the alphabet, e.g, ‘a’ will be repeated once, but ‘t’ for example with be repeated a full 20 times! Crikey.

**Rules**

- Your program/function/macro should except any characters but should only output for lowercase or uppercase letters 
- There should be no leading or trailing lines or spaces

**Examples**:

*input*:
```‘abcda’```

*output*:
```
abcda
 bcd
  cd
   d
 ```

*input*

```‘Code Golf!’```

*output*
```
Code Golf!
Code Golf
Code Golf
 ode Golf
 o e Golf
 o   Golf
 o   Gol
 o    ol
 o    ol
 o    ol
 o    ol
 o    ol
 o    o
 o    o
 o    o
```
