# Challenge #11 - Prime time to get home!

Oh no! Once again when we came into work today, we stumbled through into a __parallel universe!__ :alien:

I was late in this morning because I was busy searching for a way to get back home - and the good news I found it.

Down in the basement there are 4 new doors, one of which leads home. I've been told by my sources that only the door with a prime number on it will get us back. But hurry! The door home will __lock forever at 4:30 pm!__

### Task:

Write me a program, macro, data step or script that will work out if any positive integer is prime or not (You may return True/False or Y/N or your language choice variant).

### Examples

**Prime:**

2, 3, 19, 37, 7907

**Not Prime:**

1, 4, 7852, 7919



##### Remember only one person can be the hero so the shortest program will be remembered throughout history.

Good luck!
