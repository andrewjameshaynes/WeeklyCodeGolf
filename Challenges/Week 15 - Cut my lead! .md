How good are your DBA skills?

### Task:

Given two integers disguised as strings with leading or trailing zeros and spaces, it is your job to write a program, function, macro or data step to compare them to see if they are equal.

### Notes:

1) 0's will only be leading.
2) Spaces can be leading OR trailing.

### Examples:

- Input: ("0001", "1"), Output: True
- Input: ("00010", "1"), Output: False
- Input: ("  0001  ", "001"), Output: True
- Input: ("01764", "1765    "), Output: False
- Input: ("    0001    ", "     01               "), Output: True

This challenge should be fairly easy - but a lot of characters in *R*. Try to explore another language!
