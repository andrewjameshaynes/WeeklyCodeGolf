 # Trick-or-treat Bonus challenge! :jack_o_lantern:

Halloween Bonus challenge - YEAAHHHHHH :ghost:

### Task:

Write me a function, program or macro that for a number N, output me all the integers less than N that are *exactly in between* a square number and a cube number. (For a number x: x-1 will be square, x+1 will be a cube)

### Example:
Input: N = 50

Output: 26  

(25 is a square number (5^2), and 27 is a cube (3^3), but 26 sits between).
