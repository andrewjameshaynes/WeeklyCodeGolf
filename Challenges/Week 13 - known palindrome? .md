# Challenge #13 - known palindrome! :point_left::point_right:

Don't you hate it when a database issue causes all your data to duplicated? and even worse the duplication is reversed, and appended onto the original data? __NIGHTMARE.__

If only there were a way to sort out all these palindromes...

### Task:
Given a palindromic string OR integer, write me a function, data step, macro or program that checks whether the input is a palindrome, and then returns the correct non-palindromic version. If the number is not a palindrome, return the input unscathed.

### Examples:
- input = spongeegnops

   output = sponge


- input = 11733711

   output = 1173


-  input = scotts favourite number is 1111 si rebmun etiruovaf sttocs

    output = scotts favourite number is 11


- input = racecars

   output = racecars

**Shortest code wins!**
