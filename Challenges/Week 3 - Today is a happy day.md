 # Challenge #3 - Today is a happy day!:

What miserable weather we are having - let’s brighten up our day and make this a *HAPPY* day. To do this I want you to write me a function, macro or program that finds out whether a number is happy or not!

### How do I know if a number is happy?!

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits in base-ten, and repeat the process until the number either equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle.

### Example: 

The first 5 happy numbers are: 1, 7, 10, 13, 19

13 = 1^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 9 = 10 = 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 = :)

### Your Task:
Given an integer as an input, as an int or a string, output me either a smiley face “:)” if the number is happy, or a frowny face “:(” if the number is unhappy.

### Rules
- You program should work for any number n >0 .
- You may output any style smiley that you desire as long as it maintains the correct sentiment.
- Your program must not have a limit on the number of iterations used to discover if a number is happy or not.

Remember this is *code golf*! so the shortest answer wins.
