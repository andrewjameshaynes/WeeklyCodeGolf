# Weekly Code Golf

This is a repoistory to store the Code Golfing challenges I run for the Analytics team that I work in.

Most are shamelessly taken or adapted from the great guys at https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/. I occassionally come up with my own that I find interesting, but I try and add a bit more back story and adapt for the people in my team.

The challenges can be found here:

And my own personal solutions in R, Python, Javascript etc are located here:
